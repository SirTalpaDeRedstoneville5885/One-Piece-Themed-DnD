        "\n{@bold Using a pop green}\nWhen a character possesses a pop green, he or she can use at any time by planting it in a patch of dirt, soil, or sediment nearby. The pop green can be planted as an action, bonus action, or reaction (depending on the spell) within 5 feet of the user. It can also be thrown or fired by a sling as an action up to 30 feet away from the user into a nearby patch of soil. When the pop green is planted, it will begin casting the spell stored inside of it, no material components required.",
        "The plant created will begin casting the spell from itself. For example, if the plant created from a pop green has cone of cold stored in it, it will cast it immediately after the action the user made to plant it, blasting the 60-foot cone from itself and damaging all enemies in the range depending on the direction the user wants it to aim the spell. After the spell is finished being casted or concentrated on, it will wither and die.",
        "If the plant casts a spell, such as time stop, that can only target the caster, it will instead target the creature that planted it if they are within 30 feet of the plant. Otherwise, the plant will target itself with the spell before withering and dying. If the spell requires a target, the person who planted the pop green can verbally command it to choose the desired targets. Additionally, if the spell has a casting time longer than an action, the plant will remain alive and actively cast the spell until it is casted. Also, if the spell requires concentration, the plant will remain alive and attempt to concentrate on the spell until the duration ends or concentration is lost. Once the spell is no longer being concentrated on or is finished casting, the plant instantly withers and dies.",
        "While the plant remains alive, its stats are as follows (Treat cantrips as 1st-level spells when determining these stats). It is a large plant, its HP is equal to 5 x Spell Level (Minimum 5), its AC is equal to 10 + Spell Level (Minimum 10), it has vulnerability to fire damage, and its Constitution save bonus for keeping concentration is equal to the Spell Level. The plant's appearance depends on the type of spell stored by it. For example, if it has the fireball spell stored, it may have a reddish-orange patterned appearance, a bazooka-shaped stem, and flame-shaped leaves. The plant may also cast or create the spell effect by emitting magical effects from its stalk or mouth, or by attacking with segments of its body.",
