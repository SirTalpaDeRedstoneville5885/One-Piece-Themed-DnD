By deciding level tiers for certain areas in the world, it will be easy to balance enemies and NPCs in ways that align with player progression.",

This will be where many mid-tier pirates and powerful members of the navy reside. The sea and various islands will be difficult to traverse, with sea monsters and extreme weather conditions constantly bombarding your travel at random. Surviving to the end of Paradise should prove to be a challenge and feel like an amazing accomplishment upon completing the end. However, the next two stages should feel far more threatening.",
                                        "The third tier (levels 11-15) is where players will start facing extremely overwhelming challenges. Making your way into the second half of the Grand Line, called the New World, the party should be facing unimaginably powerful pirate crews called the Yonko (or Four Emperors). The weather and islands here are even more threatening than the first half of the grand line, enough for a majority of crews to perish upon initially reaching this area. This will be the stage where characters start training, conducting espionage on the Yonko, and collecting Road Poneglyphs.",
                                        "The final tier (levels 16-20) is the last stretch of the journey. At this legendary tier, characters should be able to stand up to Yonko pirate crews and marine admirals. Most fights will be overwhelmingly large-scale and epic, involving hundreds or thousands of pirates in huge wars and battles across the end of the New World. Once several Yonko have fallen and Road Poneglyphs are copied down, the crew can make their way to the One Piece to become pirate kings/queens and complete the adventure."

However, many humans may opt to regularly train to be on par with these races as well.",

When a non-human is introduced into a human society, it will most likely be treated more harshly than their human counterpart, oftentimes alienating them completely. Likewise, Humans may also be treated differently when entering a non-human tribe or country due to the resentment they hold. It is up to the DM to decide how to run these encounters during roleplay.",

                                "Fishmen, along with Merfolk, are one of the two races of humanoids that inhabit the sea. Fishmen are a roughly equal mix of Human and Fish, with human-like appendages and faces crossed with sea creatures such as sharks, blowfish, and other fish. They also have gills between their shoulders and necks, as well as often having webbed hands. Some species of fish-men may have extra appendages depending what on what species of fish they represent.",
				                "Fishmen have both lungs and gills, which allow them to breathe underwater and on land. Their webbed fingers and agile bodies allow them to move quickly in water for as long as they want. Some fishmen use their naturally strong bodies and unique features as a reason to believe they are superior to Humans. Despite these beliefs, fish-men often end up being the ones to become enslaved and oppressed by Humans, which drives their hatred for them even further. However, not all fish-men think this way and can actually get along well with humans as equals.",
                                "{@b Hybrids.} Fishmen have the ability to interbreed with other races, much like other humanoid races. It is not impossible to find half-humna or half-giant fishmen in places such as the grand line. Furthermore, fishmen can have children with merfolk, resulting in either a fishman or merfolk child being born.",
                                "{@b Oppressed.} Like other non-human races, fish-men are the victims of world-wide oppression by humans. Due to this, many fish-men stay within the confines of fish-man island and only occasionally leave. Some evil fish-men have opted to be pirates to seek revenge against humanity. Unfortunately, several also end up as slaves under the world government. Even on islands not directly under world government jurisdiction, humans still treat fish-men very unfairly. For this reason, playing a fish-man can prove very different when visiting various human-inhabited islands around the sea.",
                                "{@b Domination.} Though they are often misunderstood, many fish-men do hold the belief that they should rule over all other fish in the sea. And due to the cruel treatment they receive from humans, some grow to also want to conquer and rule over humanity as a whole. This isn't true of all fish-men though, as many do exhibit the desire to co-exist with other races and species.",
                                "{@b Extraordinary Strength.} As well as being born with bodies that provide natural weapons in battles, such as razor-sharp teeth, fish-men have incredibly strong bodies compared to average people. From birth, fish-men are ten times stronger than humans. Additionally, fish-men can be even more troublesome in underwater combat. Being even stronger underwater, they can easily devastate a human who isn't proficient at swimming. Unfortunately, this strength can be negated if a fish-man happens to be a Devil Fruit user.",
