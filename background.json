      "#### Feature: Knightly Regard",
      "Knights are defenders that fight for the inhabitants of a kingdom, following under the code of Chivalry. You have pledged allegiance to a kingdom or monarch, and ascended the ranks to earn your rank. You may have left your duties behind to go explore the world, but you are still well-respected by your kingdom and people. You receive shelter and succor from members of your kingdom and those who are sympathetic to its aims.",
      "This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly.",
      "#### Specialty",
      "What kingdom or monarch do you serve under? Roll on this table or choose one of the listed kingdoms to decide which kingdom you serve. You may also use a separate kingdom of your choice instead of the below ones.",

      "You were born into a family of aristocrats that are descendants of nineteen of the Twenty Kings who established what is now known as the World Government. Members of the celestial dragons are rarely seen in regular society, as many solely reside inside of Mariejois. Those who leave Mariejois permanently are rarely accepted back, and may be targeted by the world government and other celestial dragons.",

      "Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are.

You may not even be affiliated with your birth family anymore, but you can secure an audience with just about any noble family if you need to.",
      "#### Suggested Characteristics",
      "Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles, to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble. Some run away from these responsibilities in order to live a more modest or adventurous lifestyle, though this is greatly frowned upon.",

This may be done through subtle hints or simply describing what kind of weather is seen up ahead.",
      "In some instances, the weather may appear so dangerous that it would cause a great deal of damage to the ship and crew if sailed through. If the navigator is unable to find a way around this, they may choose to expend 1 pirate prestige point to completely steer clear and avoid the storm or danger. It is possible that the storm may be exceptionally dangerous, so much so that 1 pirate prestige point won't be enough to satisfy the condition and completely avoiding it. In this case, the DM may demand that you spend additional points to navigate around such a situation in the more extreme regions of the world.",
